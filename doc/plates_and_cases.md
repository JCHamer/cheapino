Plates and cases
================

[This simple plate](../plates/plate.stl) works for both v1 and v2.
It has no support or screw inserts, so not ideal for hotswap
builds, but does the job.

## V2

This is the basically the same plate with a few supports
placed where the mounting holes are. I have not tested to
actually screw this on, Im just using it without screws:
[left plate with supports](../plates/cheapino-plate-left.stl)
[right plate with supports](../plates/cheapino-plate-right.stl)

## V1

This is a VERY nice case with built-in support for tenting
and a travel solution:
