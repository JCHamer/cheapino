Cheapino V1 (Obsolete)
========

The V1 and V2 are not that different, they have the same key layout, but V2 has a lot of minor improvements, so I suggest building that!

Here are some V1 images:

@keyboard-magpie made a plate which will help position the switches: [plate.stl](../plates/v1_plate.stl)

@ggppjj made some useful modifications to miryoku and enabled LED for that as well here: https://github.com/ggppjj/qmk_firmware/releases

Drawbacks:

* V1 only: Without a plate, its pretty difficult to solder swithes straight. I made a small helper "fork" to hold each column in place when soldering. Check the build guide for a link to a really good 3D printed fork.
* RJ45 cables are a bit rigid, so they do not lay down on the table nicely like audio cables.
* There is no official qmk support, you need to compile from my branch manually... Keymap can be edited in qmk configurator though.
