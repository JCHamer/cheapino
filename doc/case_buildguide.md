V2 Case build guide
===================

This is a case I made, very compact, almost no empty space inside:

To build it, you need to 3D print all 4 parts in the thingiverse link above.
If you want to tweak something, check the readme in the case-folder in this repo.

I printed this with 100% infill, and got feedback from others testing with other
values, and the 100% infill makes a difference in sound and feel(more compact, less ping).

You will also need 18 m2 heat brass insert nuts, 4mm long and 3mm outer diameter is optimal,
along with 18 m2 screws, around 5mm long, preferably counter sunk head, since the case
has counter sunk cutouts for the head.

These are the items I ordered for my builds:

If you are interested in tenting the keyboard, you might want to order
some adhesive mag-safe rings:

Which you can use with stands to get any angle that suits you:

Im also planning to design some snap-on feet, and there are compartments
in the case for these, for future use:

Once you printed all 4 parts of the case, you need to install the m2 heat inserts.
You can insert them by using your soldering iron to heat them while applying gentle 
pressure and maybe press last 10% with a flat surface, to get a nice finish.
Overly complicated explanation here:

Try to make sure all of your components are soldered flush to the pcb so they dont obstruct the case.
Place the bottom of the case on the pcb, and check that it fits flush to the pcb, otherwise you
might need to redo a component if it sticks out and prevents the bottom fit.
(Optionally, if you have magnets, place them in the cutouts before attaching the two bottom plates)

Next place the bottom into the top case, and attach it using 9 M2 screws per side.

Lastly remove adhesives for magsafe stickers, if you have them, and attach it carefully so you
dont obstruct any screws(otherwise you will have problems dismantling the case in the future).
