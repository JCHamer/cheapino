Plates
======

The v2-cheapino-left.stl and v2-cheapino-right.stl can be used for version 2 of the Cheapino.
It should be used if you installed hotswap sockets, since you need it to hold switches in place
(they are not soldered then...)

Takes 1-2 hours pers plate to print, depending on settings.
There are holes for screws, but they are a bit narrow, so use a nail or similar,
size depending on your screws, heat it and push it slowly down to expand the screwhole.
The PCB mounting holes are M4 sized, but you probably shouldnt use the entire width.

I guess optimally, I should make a version with M2 inserts that can be melted in(TODO).

The v1 file is a simple plate for just holding the switches in place.
Its suitable for Cheapino v1. Just print 2 and turn one upside down for the other side.
